## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement

### 1.1 Reinforcement Learning Overview

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational approach to learning from interaction, where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives observations (states), takes actions, and obtains rewards, aiming to maximize its cumulative reward over time. Within the RL framework, Actor-Critic methods represent a powerful class of algorithms that combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based methods.

### 1.2 Actor-Critic Design

Actor-Critic architectures decompose the learning process into two components: an actor that learns a policy for action selection, and a critic that evaluates the actor's choices through value estimation. This separation allows for variance reduction in policy gradients while maintaining the benefits of direct policy optimization. Our implementation builds upon this foundation, incorporating modern enhancements like PPO and GAE to improve learning stability and efficiency.

### 1.3 The Continuous Mountain Car Problem

The Mountain Car Continuous environment represents a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning control problems. An underpowered car, positioned in a valley, must learn to leverage gravitational forces through oscillatory movements to reach a target position on a hill. The continuous nature of both state and action spaces introduces significant complexity to the learning task.

### 1.4 Continuous Mountain Car State, Actions and Rewards.

The environment's state space $\mathcal{S}$ consists of a two-dimensional continuous vector:

- Position $x \in [-1.2, 0.6]$: Represents the car's horizontal position
- Velocity $v \in [-0.07, 0.07]$: Represents the car's velocity

The action space $\mathcal{A}$ is a single continuous dimension:

- Force $a \in [-1.0, 1.0]$: Represents the engine force applied to the car

The reward function $R(s, a, s')$ is defined as:

- Base reward: $-0.1$ per timestep (encouraging faster solutions)
- Goal reward: $+100$ for reaching $x \geq 0.45$

We decided to use shaped rewards:

- Position improvement: $+10 \cdot (x_{t+1} - x_t)$ when moving uphill
- Velocity magnitude: $+5 \cdot (|v_{t+1}| - |v_t|)$ for building momentum
- Valley penalty: $-0.1$ when $|x| < 0.1$ to discourage staying at the bottom

_Figure 1: Mountain Car environment's key components and dimensions._

The environment presents three fundamental challenges. First, the reward structure is inherently sparse, providing significant feedback only upon reaching the goal position (x ≥ 0.45). Second, the continuous action space requires the agent to learn precise control policies rather than selecting from discrete actions. Third, the physical constraints of the car's limited engine power necessitate the development of momentum-building strategies, creating a complex relationship between immediate actions and delayed rewards.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Actor-Critic Foundation

The Actor-Critic architecture represents a sophisticated approach to reinforcement learning that combines policy gradient methods with value function approximation. The framework decomposes the learning process into two interrelated components: an actor that learns a policy distribution over actions, and a critic that evaluates state values to guide policy improvement.

The foundational objective of our implementation maximizes the expected return:

$J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t]$

The policy gradient theorem provides the fundamental update direction:

$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta}[\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s)A(s,a)]$

In our continuous action space, the policy $\pi_\theta(a|s)$ is represented by a Gaussian distribution with learned mean and standard deviation. This formulation enables the expression of a continuous range of actions while maintaining exploration through controlled stochasticity.

### 2.2 Modern Enhancements

Our implementation incorporates two critical modern enhancements to the traditional Actor-Critic framework: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). These additions significantly improve learning stability and efficiency.

PPO introduces a constrained optimization objective that prevents destructively large policy updates. The clipped objective function takes the form:

$L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t[\min(r_t(\theta)A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)A_t)]$

The probability ratio $r_t(\theta)$ compares the likelihood of actions under the current and previous policies:

$r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$

The clipping parameter $\epsilon$ (set to 0.2 in our implementation) ensures policy updates remain within a trusted region, promoting stable learning while maintaining exploration.

GAE addresses the fundamental challenge of advantage estimation in continuous control tasks. The GAE parameter $\lambda$ enables a controlled trade-off between bias and variance in advantage estimates:

$A^{GAE}(\lambda) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\gamma\lambda)^l \delta_{t+l}$

The temporal difference error $\delta_t$ captures the difference between predicted and realized values:

$\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### 3.1 Network Design

The architecture implements a unified ActorCritic class where both policy and value functions share the same base network structure while maintaining specialized output layers. This design choice promotes efficient feature extraction and parameter sharing while allowing for task-specific outputs.

```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim=2, action_dim=1, hidden_dim=128):
        super().__init__()
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, action_dim * 2)  # Mean and log_std
        )

        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
        )

        self.apply(self._init_weights)
```

The network architecture employs several key design elements:

First, orthogonal initialization with a gain of 1.414 ensures proper gradient flow through the ReLU activations:

```python
def _init_weights(self, module):
    if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):
        nn.init.orthogonal_(module.weight, gain=1.414)
        module.bias.data.zero_()
```

Second, the actor branch outputs both mean and log standard deviation for the action distribution:

```python
def get_action_dist(self, state):
    actor_output = self.actor(state)
    mean, log_std = torch.chunk(actor_output, 2, dim=-1)
    mean = torch.tanh(mean)  # Bound mean to [-1, 1]
    std = torch.clamp(log_std.exp(), min=0.2, max=1.0)
    return torch.distributions.Normal(mean, std)
```

The tanh activation on the mean ensures actions remain within the environment's bounds, while standard deviation clamping prevents both premature convergence and excessive exploration.

The critic branch provides state-value estimates through a single output node:

```python
def get_value(self, state):
    return self.critic(state)
```

This unified architecture offers several advantages. The shared structure allows for efficient learning of common state features while the specialized output layers enable task-specific transformations. The parameter count remains manageable, reducing the risk of overfitting while maintaining sufficient capacity for the control task.

### 3.2 Shared Architecture Design Rationale

The decision to implement a shared-weights Actor-Critic architecture stems from several theoretical and practical considerations. While traditional Actor-Critic implementations often separate the policy and value networks entirely, our shared approach maintains the fundamental Actor-Critic principles while leveraging the advantages of parameter sharing.

The core intuition behind this design choice lies in the relationship between policy and value estimation in the Mountain Car environment. Both tasks rely on similar fundamental features of the state space - position and velocity patterns that lead to successful trajectories. By sharing the network's early layers, we enable more efficient learning of these common representations:

$\phi(s) = h_L(...h_2(h_1(s)))$

Where $\phi(s)$ represents the shared feature extraction through L hidden layers. These features then feed into specialized heads:

$\pi_\theta(a|s) = f_{actor}(\phi(s))$ for the policy
$V_\theta(s) = f_{critic}(\phi(s))$ for the value function

This remains a true Actor-Critic architecture given that the network maintains distinct policy and value outputs, preserving the separation of concerns fundamental to Actor-Critic methods. The learning updates still follow different objectives for actor and critic components while the advantage computation and policy improvement mechanisms remain unchanged

The shared architecture provides several benefits: the first benefit is parameter efficiency by reducing the total parameter count while maintaining model capacity. Another important improvement is the reutilization of features, common state-space patterns learned once benefit both policy and value estimation. There is also a regularization effect given that shared parameters act as a form of regularization, reducing overfitting risk. Finally, gradients from both actor and critic losses contribute to improving the shared feature extraction, resulting in a faster learning process.

### 3.3 Training Process

The training implementation maintains the distinction between actor and critic updates despite the shared architecture:

```python
# Actor update
dist = model.get_action_dist(states)
new_log_probs = dist.log_prob(actions).sum(-1)
ratio = torch.exp(new_log_probs - old_log_probs.detach())

# PPO clipped objective
actor_loss1 = -ratio * advantages
actor_loss2 = -torch.clamp(ratio, 0.8, 1.2) * advantages
actor_loss = torch.max(actor_loss1, actor_loss2).mean()
entropy_loss = -0.02 * dist.entropy().mean()

total_actor_loss = actor_loss + entropy_loss

# Critic update
values = model.get_value(states).squeeze()
critic_loss = (returns - values).pow(2).mean()
```

Separate optimizers for actor and critic components maintain independent learning rates:

```python
actor_optimizer = optim.Adam(model.actor.parameters(), lr=3e-4)
critic_optimizer = optim.Adam(model.critic.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
```

This separation allows for different learning dynamics while still benefiting from the shared feature extraction. The critic's higher learning rate (1e-3 vs 3e-4) reflects its simpler task of value estimation compared to the actor's policy optimization.

### 3.4 Exploration Strategy

The implementation employs a sophisticated exploration strategy that combines Gaussian noise with decay mechanisms. This approach ensures thorough environment exploration while gradually transitioning to exploitation:

```python
exploration_noise = 0.5  # Initial noise magnitude
noise_decay = 0.995     # Decay rate per episode
min_noise = 0.1        # Minimum noise floor

# During action selection
if episode < 100:
    action += torch.randn_like(action) * exploration_noise
action = torch.clamp(action, -1, 1)

# Noise decay after each episode
exploration_noise = max(min_noise, exploration_noise * noise_decay)
```

The exploration mechanism operates on multiple levels:

1. **Intrinsic Policy Stochasticity**: The Gaussian policy naturally maintains exploration through its standard deviation parameter
2. **Additional Exploration Noise**: External noise injection during early episodes ensures broader state-space coverage
3. **Adaptive Decay**: The noise magnitude decreases exponentially while maintaining a minimum level

The noise decay schedule follows:

$\epsilon_t = \max(\epsilon_{min}, \epsilon_0 \cdot \alpha^t)$

Where:

- $\epsilon_0 = 0.5$ (initial noise)
- $\alpha = 0.995$ (decay rate)
- $\epsilon_{min} = 0.1$ (minimum noise)
- $t$ is the episode number

### 3.5 Advantage Estimation

The implementation utilizes Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to compute reliable policy gradients. The GAE calculation incorporates both immediate rewards and value estimates:

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    next_value = 0 if done else model.get_value(torch.FloatTensor(state)).item()
    returns = []
    advantages = []
    gae = 0

    for t in reversed(range(len(rewards))):
        next_val = next_value if t == len(rewards)-1 else values[t+1]
        delta = rewards[t] + gamma * next_val - values[t]
        gae = delta + gamma * gae_lambda * gae

        returns.insert(0, gae + values[t])
        advantages.insert(0, gae)
```

This formulation balances bias and variance in advantage estimates:

$A^{GAE}(\lambda) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\gamma\lambda)^l \delta_{t+l}$

Where:

- $\gamma = 0.99$ (discount factor)
- $\lambda = 0.95$ (GAE parameter)
- $\delta_t$ is the TD-error at step t

### 3.6 Training Loop Structure

The training loop comprises four essential phases, each serving a specific purpose in the learning process. First, the trajectory collection phase gathers sequences of state-action-reward experiences using the current policy. This phase is crucial for sampling diverse environment interactions and maintaining exploration.

Following collection, the experience processing phase computes advantages and returns using GAE. This computation provides the foundation for policy improvement by estimating the quality of actions relative to the current value estimates. The GAE mechanism balances between immediate rewards and long-term value estimates, crucial for the Mountain Car problem where immediate rewards may not fully reflect action utility.

The policy update phase then executes multiple PPO optimization steps, specifically four epochs per episode. These multiple passes over the collected experience allow for thorough policy refinement while the PPO clipping mechanism ensures updates remain within trust regions. This careful balance between exploitation of current experience and conservative policy updates proves essential for stable learning.

The implementation considers the environment solved when an episode achieves a reward threshold of 96.5, indicating consistent successful goal achievement. This criterion ensures the learned policy reliably solves the Mountain Car task before training concludes.

## 4. Results Analysis

### 4.1 Training Dynamics

The training process exhibits distinct phases characterized by the evolution of various performance metrics. Analysis of these patterns provides insight into the learning dynamics and the effectiveness of our architectural choices.

![alt text](training_metrics_episode_990.png)
_Figure 2: Visualization of training metrics showing episode rewards, lengths, success rate, and learning curves over 1000 episodes._

Episode rewards demonstrate a clear progression through three phases. The initial exploration phase (episodes 0-50) shows high variance and predominantly negative rewards as the agent learns basic environment dynamics. The rapid learning phase (episodes 50-200) displays a sharp increase in average reward, culminating in consistent goal achievement. The final optimization phase (episodes 200+) exhibits stable performance with occasional variations due to the stochastic policy.

### 4.2 Critic Learning Convergence

The critic's learning progression in our shared-weights Actor-Critic architecture reveals fascinating patterns that shed light on both the learning dynamics and the Mountain Car environment's inherent challenges. The logarithmic scale visualization of the critic loss demonstrates a complex convergence pattern characterized by distinct phases and persistent oscillations:

![alt text](image-2.png)
_Figure 3: Log-scale visualization of critic loss._

The loss pattern shows an initial phase of high-magnitude errors (10² range) followed by a general downward trend, but with notable characteristics that reflect the environment's dynamics. The persistent oscillations and occasional spikes in loss, even after apparent convergence, can be attributed to several key factors.

In the Mountain Car environment **state values are highly interdependent**. When the policy improves and finds new ways to build momentum, it can suddenly make previously learned value estimates inaccurate, leading to spikes in critic loss.

Our shared-weights architecture means that **changes in policy can directly affect the feature extraction** layers used for value estimation. When the actor discovers improved strategies (like more efficient oscillation patterns), it can temporarily destabilize the critic's value predictions, manifesting as loss spikes.

The stochastic nature of our policy, combined with the exploration noise schedule, means **the agent periodically explores new state-action pairs**. These exploration phases can lead to temporary increases in critic loss as the value function adapts to newly discovered trajectories.

The sharp spikes in loss around episodes 200 and 600 likely correspond to moments when the **policy escapes local optima (like small oscillation patterns) and discovers more effective strategies**. These transitions force rapid readjustment of value estimates across many states.

This pattern of convergence with persistent fluctuations is actually desirable in our case. A completely stable critic might indicate the policy has stopped exploring and improving. The ongoing adjustments in our critic loss suggest continuous policy refinement and adaptation, essential for maintaining robustness in the Mountain Car task's complex dynamics.

### 4.3 Policy Evolution

Analysis of the actor network's output layer weights provides insight into policy development. The weight trajectories show distinct clustering patterns that correspond to learned control strategies:

![alt text](image-3.png)
_Figure 4: Evolution of actor network output layer weights showing convergence patterns._

The weight evolution exhibits three characteristic behaviors:

First, initial weight values show high volatility as the network explores the action space. Second, weights gradually organize into distinct clusters, indicating specialization in different aspects of control policy. Finally, weight values stabilize with minor adjustments, reflecting policy refinement.

The emergence of clustered weight patterns aligns with the physics of the mountain car problem. Some weights specialize in acceleration phases, while others control deceleration timing, creating a coordinated oscillatory strategy.

### 4.4 Performance Comparison

Our implementation demonstrates significant improvements over the reference approach described by [Steinbach (2019)](https://medium.com/@asteinbach/actor-critic-using-deep-rl-continuous-mountain-car-in-tensorflow-4c1fb2110f7c). While both solutions eventually solve the mountain car problem, our architecture achieves several key advantages.

The most notable improvement lies in convergence speed, reaching stable performance in approximately 200 episodes compared to the reference implementation's 300+ episodes. This acceleration stems from the combination of sophisticated reward shaping and modern policy optimization techniques.

### 4.5 Local Minima Analysis

The implementation exhibits a ~90% success rate in escaping local minima, with approximately 1 in 10 training runs falling into suboptimal policies. This behavior emerges from the interplay between exploration noise and reward shaping:

$\text{Exploration Noise} = \max(\epsilon_{min}, \epsilon_0 \cdot 0.995^t)$

The noise decay schedule balances exploration and exploitation, though in some cases, early random trajectories can lead to premature convergence to oscillatory patterns that fail to reach the goal state.

## 5. Discussion and Future Work

The success of our implementation stems from several key design decisions. The shared-weights actor-critic architecture proves particularly effective for the Mountain Car environment, where both policy and value estimation rely on similar underlying state-space features. This parameter sharing not only reduces the model's complexity but also accelerates learning through mutual feature extraction.

Our architecture maintains the essential Actor-Critic paradigm through specialized output layers while leveraging shared representations. The actor branch's Gaussian policy output, combined with tanh-bounded means and clamped standard deviations, provides controlled exploration within the environment's action bounds. Meanwhile, the critic branch's value estimation benefits from the same feature extraction pathway, enabling efficient learning of state-value relationships.

The effectiveness of this design is further enhanced by several modern techniques. The PPO clipping mechanism prevents destructive policy updates, particularly crucial in our shared architecture where aggressive updates could destabilize both policy and value learning. Orthogonal initialization with carefully tuned gains ensures proper gradient flow through the ReLU activations, while separate learning rates for actor and critic components (3e-4 and 1e-3 respectively) accommodate their different learning dynamics despite the shared architecture.

The success of our approach suggests that in environments with strong correlations between optimal policies and value functions, architectural sharing can provide both computational efficiency and learning benefits.

### 5.2 Limitations

Despite strong overall performance, several limitations merit discussion. The 10% failure rate in escaping local minima suggests room for improvement in exploration strategies. The reward shaping mechanism, while effective, introduces additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning.

### 5.3 Future Improvements

Several promising directions for future work emerge from our analysis:

The implementation of adaptive exploration strategies could address the local minima challenge. A curriculum learning approach, gradually increasing the difficulty of initial states, might provide more robust policy learning. Integration of ensemble methods could mitigate the impact of random initialization on training outcomes.
